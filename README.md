# Multi-perspective-Natural-Vector
The rapid expansion of biological data in recent decades has highlighted the need for efficient computational methods in sequence analysis. Traditional alignment-based approaches are both time-consuming and memory-intensive, while most alignment-free methods suffer from a lack of interpretability. This study introduces a novel alignment-free method called Multi-perspective Natural Vector (MNV) to capture the geometric and periodic characteristics of viral genome sequences. The MNV method maps genome sequences of varying lengths to points within a unified geometric space, thereby facilitating downstream tasks such as variant classification and clustering. In convex hull separation, neural network classification and clustering applications across datasets of different sizes and types, MNV outperforms Natural Vector and kmer methods. The MNV method achieves near-perfect deep learning classification accuracy of \rev{99.94$\%$} and \rev{99.91$\%$} on SARS-CoV-2 and Poliovirus datasets respectively. In addition, MNV attains 100$\%$ convex hull separation ratio across three independent datasets in lower dimension compared with other methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in viral genome analysis while maintaining computational efficiency.
